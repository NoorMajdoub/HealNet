# HealNet: AI-based Medical Assistance for War Victims

HealNet is an AI-powered application designed to assist in diagnosing and providing recommendations based on medical data, specifically targeting common injuries, infections, and blood pressure-related conditions for war victims. This application leverages machine learning and image recognition models to evaluate injuries or health issues and provide a structured diagnosis pipeline.

## Features

- **Injury Assessment:**
  - Detects injuries from images, such as fractures and dislocations.
  - Collects data from users to assess the injury severity.
  - Provides detailed recommendations or directs the user to seek professional medical help if necessary.

- **Infection Detection:**
  - Identifies symptoms of infections from user-provided images.
  - Offers a structured questioning pipeline to assess the level of infection and severity.
  - Suggests home remedies or recommends a doctor based on severity.

- **Blood Pressure and Stroke Risk Detection:**
  - Analyzes user-provided images to detect signs related to blood pressure and stroke risk.
  - Guides users through a diagnostic process to determine their health status.

- **AI-Powered Conversational Assistant:**
  - Provides a step-by-step conversational flow for gathering data from users about their health condition.
  - Based on the information provided, the assistant will evaluate and generate recommendations.

- **Medical Folder Database:**
  - All user interactions are stored in a **MySQL database**, creating a unique medical folder for each patient.
  - Medical data and diagnosis history are stored in real-time to provide a comprehensive view of the patient's medical history.
  - Each patient can access their medical information at any time via a global patient portal.

## How It Works

### Step-by-Step Injury Assessment:
1. **Image Upload:** 
   - The user uploads an image of their injury, which is then analyzed for signs of fractures, dislocations, or other injuries.
   
2. **Conversation Flow:** 
   - The assistant asks a series of structured questions to gather more data (e.g., pain levels, movement limitations).
   
3. **Diagnosis:** 
   - Based on the responses and image analysis, the assistant determines whether the user may have a fracture or other injury and provides recommendations.

4. **Final Recommendations:** 
   - If the injury is not deemed severe, the assistant provides home remedies. If it's severe, the assistant recommends seeking a doctor.

### Infection Assessment:
1. **Image Upload:** 
   - The user uploads an image showing signs of infection, such as wounds, skin conditions, or swelling.

2. **Conversation Flow:** 
   - The assistant follows a set of questions to determine the severity of the infection.
   
3. **Diagnosis:** 
   - Based on the analysis of the image and the user's responses, the assistant evaluates the infection risk.

4. **Final Recommendations:** 
   - Depending on the severity, the assistant either suggests home remedies or advises seeing a doctor.

### Blood Pressure & Stroke Risk:
1. **Image Upload:** 
   - The user uploads a related image or data indicating possible blood pressure issues or stroke risks.

2. **Diagnostic Questions:** 
   - The assistant asks questions related to the user's medical history and symptoms.

3. **Diagnosis:** 
   - Based on the uploaded data and responses, the assistant evaluates the likelihood of stroke or high blood pressure.

4. **Recommendations:** 
   - If the risk is minimal, home remedies or lifestyle changes are suggested. If the risk is high, the assistant advises seeking professional medical attention.

## AI Models

### **Injury Diagnosis Model:**
- Uses advanced deep learning models, including **Vision Transformers (ViT)**, to analyze images for signs of fractures, dislocations, or other injuries.
- The model has been trained to identify key features such as bone fractures and displacement.

### **Infection Diagnosis Model:**
- A deep learning-based image recognition model that analyzes uploaded images for signs of infection.
- The assistant uses a structured pipeline to ask the user targeted questions based on the detected symptoms.

### **Blood Pressure & Stroke Risk Model:**
- A classification model that predicts the likelihood of stroke or high blood pressure based on user data and images.

## MySQL Database: Storing Patient Medical Folders

### Overview:
HealNet utilizes a **MySQL database** to store patient information in real-time as the user interacts with the medical assistant. This ensures that each userâ€™s medical history is automatically updated as they progress through the conversation. The system also provides the patient with the ability to access their medical data at any time.

### **Database Schema:**

The database stores patient medical data in a table structure, where each entry corresponds to a **unique user**. The schema is as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE patients (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(100),
    last_name VARCHAR(100),
    dob DATE,
    medical_history TEXT,
    diagnosis TEXT,
    recommendations TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE injuries (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    patient_id INT,
    injury_description TEXT,
    injury_type VARCHAR(100),
    injury_severity VARCHAR(50),
    diagnosis TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (patient_id) REFERENCES patients(id)
);

CREATE TABLE infections (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    patient_id INT,
    infection_description TEXT,
    infection_type VARCHAR(100),
    severity VARCHAR(50),
    treatment_recommendations TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (patient_id) REFERENCES patients(id)
);
```

### **Real-Time Data Storage:**
- As patients engage with the medical assistant, their responses and diagnosis history are stored in real-time.
- The assistant continuously updates the database with each new assessment and recommendation.

### **Access to Medical Folders:**
- Each patient is assigned a unique medical folder in the database.
- The medical folder stores all interactions, diagnosis, and recommendations for easy access at any time.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NoorMajdoub/HealNet.git
   cd HealNet

3. **Set Up MySQL Database:**
   - Create a MySQL database and tables based on the schema provided above.
   - Ensure the database connection credentials are correctly configured in the `.env` file.

4. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file to store sensitive keys like database credentials.
   Example:
   ```env
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=root

## API Endpoints

### **POST /injury-assessment/**
- This endpoint allows users to submit data related to their injury for assessment.
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
